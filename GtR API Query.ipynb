Compared to the previously described combinatorial mutant casper, the crystal mutant lacks pigmentation also in the retinal pigment epithelium, therefore enabling optical access to the eyes.

This drug is usually used to inhibit pigmentation in zebrafish in order to allow in vivo imaging. However, PTU has several negative effects, including poor target selectivity, leading to reduced thyroid hormone synthesis, decreased eye size, abnormal cranial neural crest and extra-ocular muscle development, impaired retinal light adaptation, as well as anxiety and reduced mobility, hatching and survival. \\nThe new zebrafish line allows unobstructed in vivo imaging of cells, including within the intact retina. We envisage that crystal will be an invaluable tool for other in vivo applications,\\nsuch as one-photon or two-photon volumetric calcium imaging of neural activity across the entire brain in semi-restrained behaving or paralysed fictively swimming zebrafish larvae, as well as to study the wiring, function and plasticity of neural circuits in normally highly pigmented, optically inaccessible structures like the eyes.\",\n",
